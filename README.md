## Development Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Source files are located inside `src/`, so you need to add it to Python search path:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
```

Consider adding it to your `.bashrc` so that you don't have to type it every time.
